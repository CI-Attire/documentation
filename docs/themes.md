There are some available themes using different CSS Frameworks which are excellent start point for your next project. Hereâ€™s an example with the Bootstrap Framework.

First, install the new theme with composer:

    composer require attire/bootstrap-theme

Next open the config file `path/to/application/config/attire.php` and set the theme:

``` php
<?php
$config['theme'] = [
	'name'   => 'bootstrap',
	'layout' => 'jumbotron',
];
```

And finally load it with the `render()` method:

``` php
<?php defined('BASEPATH') OR exit('No direct script access allowed');

class Welcome extends CI_Controller
{
	public function index()
	{
		$this->load->library('attire');
		$this->attire->render();
	}
}
```

Refresh your browser to see the changes:

Also you can set a theme with the `setTheme` method as well:

``` php
<?php
class Welcome extends CI_Controller
{
	public function index()
	{
		$this->load->library('attire');
		$this->attire->setTheme('bootstrap')->setLayout('jumbotron');
		$this->attire->render();
	}
}
```

Now you can use the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework in your application.
